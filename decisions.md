# Decisions (ADR-lite)

Append one entry per non-obvious decision. Mark superseded entries rather than
deleting them; prune anything older than a quarter that no longer guides work.

## ADR-0001: Claude Code hooks live in `.claude/hooks/`, not `.specify/scripts/hooks/`

- Date: 2026-09-11
- Status: accepted
- Context: the v2 playbook (`imporvements/imporvements2.md` Part 4) places gate
  hooks in `.specify/scripts/hooks/`, which assumes a consuming spec-kit project.
  This repo is the extension itself and has no `.specify/` directory.
- Decision: harness-specific hooks and `settings.json` live under `.claude/`;
  `specflow/` stays harness-neutral runtime payload.
- Consequences: hooks are not part of the `git archive` spec-kit installs, so a
  consuming project copies them deliberately. `specflow/` stays free of
  Claude-only files, which keeps the Copilot CLI target unaffected.
